[00:12.740]I used to rule the world
[00:16.480]Seas would rise when I gave the word
[00:19.120]Now in the morning I sleep alone
[00:23.240]Sweep the streets I used to own
[00:27.490]
[00:40.670]I used to roll the dice
[00:44.200]Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
[00:47.430]Listen as the crowd would sing:
[00:51.240]"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
[00:54.450]One minute I held the key
[00:58.070]Next the walls were closed on me
[01:01.160]And I discovered that my castles stand
[01:05.060]Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
[01:08.090]
[01:08.940]I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
[01:12.550]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
[01:16.130]Be my mirror my sword and shield
[01:19.550]My missionaries in a foreign field
[01:23.100]For some reason I can not explain
[01:26.500]Once you go there was never, never an honest word
[01:32.960]That was when I ruled the world
[01:38.590]
[01:50.180]It was the wicked and wild wind
[01:55.870]Blew down the doors to let me in.
[01:58.280]Shattered windows and the sound of drums
[02:02.230]People could not believe what I'd become
[02:04.130]Revolutionaries Wait
[02:09.070]For my head on a silver plate
[02:12.240]Just a puppet on a lonely string
[02:16.280]Oh who would ever want to be king?
[02:18.870]
[02:20.280]I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
[02:23.670]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
[02:27.190]Be my mirror my sword and shield
[02:30.670]My missionaries in a foreign field
[02:35.300]For some reason I can not explain
[02:37.920]I know Saint Peter won't call my name
[02:40.820]Never an honest word
[02:43.670]But that was when I ruled the world
[02:48.270]
[03:00.660](Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
[03:16.040]Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
[03:19.060]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
[03:22.490]Be my mirror my sword and shield
[03:25.850]My missionaries in a foreign field
[03:29.420]For some reason I can not explain
[03:32.840]I know Saint Peter won't call my name
[03:36.340]Never an honest word
[03:39.280]But that was when I ruled the world
[03:43.470]
